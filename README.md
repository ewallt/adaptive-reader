# Adaptive Reader

Adaptive Reader is a small collection of static HTML readers. Each reader folder contains an
`index.html` file that can be opened directly in your browser. The pages include a simple
light/dark theme switcher and store your theme preference in `localStorage`.

## Readers

- [N.T. Wright Theology](./n-t-wright/) - Summary of "The Day the Revolution Began"
- [Non-Violent Theology](./non-violent/) - Overview of contemporary non-violent Christian thought

## Features



- Multiple content readers in one repository

- Light/dark theme switching

- Responsive design

- Typography-focused design

- Persistent theme preferences



## Quick Start



1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate to a reader folder (for example `n-t-wright` or `non-violent`)

3. Open `index.html` in your browser



## Creating New Readers

There is no dedicated template yet. You can create a new reader by copying an existing reader folder and modifying its `index.html`.

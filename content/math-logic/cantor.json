      "display_name": "The Old Infinity",
      "introduction": "Before Georg Cantor, infinity was a concept that mathematicians treated with extreme caution. It was a philosophical idea representing a process that never ends, not a concrete object to be measured or compared. Cantor's work would fundamentally change this forever.",

          "heading": "Potential vs. Actual Infinity",
          "content": "The dominant view, inherited from the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, was the distinction between 'potential' and 'actual' infinity. A line segment could be potentially infinite because you could, in theory, keep dividing it forever. However, the idea of an 'actual' infinity—a completed, existing set containing an infinite number of things—was considered a logical absurdity."

          "heading": "A 'Horror of the Infinite'",
          "content": "Many great mathematicians shared this view. Carl Friedrich Gauss, one of the most influential mathematicians of all time, famously stated, 'I protest against the use of an infinite quantity as an actual entity; this is never allowed in mathematics.' Infinity was a boundary to be approached, not a quantity to be manipulated."

          "heading": "The Paradoxes of Naive Thinking",
          "content": "This caution was well-founded. Naive thinking about infinity led to baffling paradoxes. For example, there are clearly more natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) than there are even numbers (2, 4, 6, ...). Yet, for every natural number, you can find a corresponding even number by multiplying by two. This suggested the whole could be the same size as one of its parts, a contradiction that made most mathematicians avoid the topic altogether."

          "heading": "The Need for a New Language",
          "content": "To move past these paradoxes, mathematics needed a new, rigorous language for talking about collections of objects, both finite and infinite. It needed a way to define precisely what it means for two sets to be 'the same size' without relying on the flawed intuitions of finite counting. This is the stage Georg Cantor stepped onto."

If you can pair up every element of Set A with exactly one element of Set B, with no elements left over in either set, then the two sets must be the same size. This works for finite sets (like pairing students with chairs) and, as Cantor showed, it could be applied to infinite sets as well."

For infinite sets, he introduced new symbols, called transfinite numbers, to represent their different sizes. The cardinality of the set of natural numbers, the first level of infinity, he named ℵ₀ (Aleph-Naught)."

Between any two fractions, there are infinitely more fractions, suggesting the set is much 'denser'. Yet Cantor devised a method to list all positive fractions in a grid and then trace a serpentine path through it, creating a single, countable list. This proved that the infinity of fractions is also just ℵ₀."

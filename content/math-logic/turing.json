He proved that any formal system for arithmetic would be incomplete (it couldn't prove all truths) and that it couldn't prove its own consistency. But the third pillar, Decidability, remained standing. This was the 'Entscheidungsproblem' or 'Decision Problem': could there exist a definite, mechanical method—an algorithm—that could determine the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement?"

If such a method existed, one could build a machine, feed it any conjecture (like Goldbach's Conjecture or the Riemann Hypothesis), turn a crank, and receive a definitive 'Yes' or 'No' answer. It was a question not just about proof, but about the very nature of procedure and process."

This methodology posits Jesus' life, death, and character as the ultimate interpretive key for understanding God's nature throughout the entire Bible. The practical meaning of this approach is to provide a consistent vision of God's character, helping to reconcile seemingly contradictory biblical portrayals and offering a helpful framework for life, theology, and ministry."

                            "content": "To address the violent passages in the Hebrew Bible, Boyd's cruciform hermeneutic suggests that while \"something else is going on\" in these texts, it is not that God is actively inflicting violence. Instead, Boyd's concept of divine accommodation implies that God is \"taking upon Himself the violence of the whole world\". This perspective argues that violence originates from humanity, not from God, and that human perspectives and fallen conditions are reflected in some biblical narratives. A specific example used by Boyd to illustrate this is the <strong>Canaanite conquests in the book of Joshua</strong>, where he suggests that the extreme violence, such as the killing of an infant by Hebrew soldiers who believed they were commanded by Yahweh, should be understood as God bearing human violence rather than inflicting it."

He explicitly rejects traditional atonement theories, such as satisfaction or penal substitution, that suggest God the Father needed or demanded Jesus' death as a blood sacrifice to appease divine anger or satisfy retributive justice. Instead, Boyd asserts that humanity was responsible for putting Jesus to death on the cross, motivated by the \"age-old crime of scapegoating an innocent victim\". Jesus willingly submitted to this human violence to both expose and neutralize it. The Cross, in Boyd's view, unmasked the <strong>scapegoat mechanism</strong> and revealed the violence inherent in the human heart. It laid bare \"the lie that violence toward an innocent victim helps alleviate the curse of sin\". Thus, the crucifixion represents Jesus' victory through non-violent means over the powers and principalities, overturning the \"religion of scapegoating and sacrifice\"."

His solution to this problem involves the concept of <strong>divine withdrawal</strong>. He proposes that in these violent instances, including Jesus' cry from the cross, God is \"withdrawing Himself\" from the people and nations experiencing or inflicting violence. This allows Boyd to explain how violence occurs without attributing it to God's direct will or nature, emphasizing that God is not actively inflicting but rather allowing or bearing suffering in these contexts. He acknowledges that some may find the idea of God withdrawing uncomfortable, yet he presents it as a consistent element in his cruciform understanding of God's steadfast non-violence."

Jesus' crucifixion serves to reveal this \"violence inherent within the heart of men\". Consequently, Boyd's emphasis on God's non-violent character calls believers to reflect this nature in their own lives. A key aspect of this theological anthropology is the imperative for Christians to embody God's non-violent character through <strong>enemy-love</strong>. This means actively rejecting violence and instead practicing compassion and forgiveness, even towards adversaries."

It encourages believers to act peaceably and non-violently, consistently embodying Jesus' instructions on enemy-love. This translates into a commitment to non-violent resistance against systems and powers that perpetuate violence and injustice. Drawing inspiration from figures like Walter Wink, Boyd's framework suggests a practical, three-part approach to engaging societal challenges: 1) naming the Powers by courageously exposing abuses of power; 2) unmasking the Powers by revealing their social, economic, psychological, and spiritual dynamics of oppression; and 3) engaging the Powers by wrestling with them not to destroy, but to call them back to their higher, God-given vocation. This theological perspective has informed practical activism, such as Scottish land reform and opposing the Isle of Harris superquarry, where spiritual insights animated concrete actions. It has also influenced discussions on nonviolence within professional contexts, including lectures to senior military officers."

He argues that theology itself can inadvertently \"open the door for violence as an expression of God's will\".

This perspective understands Jesus' victory over evil powers not as a violent murder initiated by God, but through His pacifist and countercultural life and teaching, His refusal to retaliate, and God's nonviolent raising of Jesus from the dead. This resurrection is central, as it validates Jesus' way of life as God's way and exposes the powers as rebellious against God.

It is not actually supported by the biblical texts often cited in its defense, such as those from Paul, Hebrews, or Old Testament sacrifices. It misrepresents the God of the Bible as a God who requires an act of retributive violence at the core of salvation, rather than employing thoroughly peaceable means. It is complicit in the long-standing oppression of vulnerable people, explicitly naming African-Americans and women. Weaver argues that the traditional view makes God the \"violent perpetrator\" by suggesting God demanded Jesus' blood sacrifice to appease anger."

He emphasizes interpreting all theology, including views of God and Jesus, in relation to how they align with pacifist convictions. Weaver's overall hermeneutic, similar to Boyd's \"cruciform hermeneutic,\" insists that Jesus' non-violent life and crucifixion serve as the guiding lens through which the entire Old Testament, including its violent portions, must be understood.

These \"Powers\" represent systemic evil, and Jesus' victory is achieved through His life of freedom from these powers and His faithfulness unto death and resurrection, which exposed their true nature and ultimate weakness. This confrontation between Jesus and the forces of evil (e.g., the Roman Empire) is where the \"cosmic battle\" is primarily located."

His work aims to construct an atonement theory that aligns with critiques from Black, feminist, and womanist theologies, which are concerned with issues of systemic oppression.

Flood argues that Jesus himself felt not only free, but in some sense obliged, to question the scriptures, which should empower believers to do the same without guilt.

Flood's concept of <strong>\"trajectory reading\"</strong> is key here: he posits that the New Testament establishes a clear trajectory away from coercion and violence, moving towards a more peaceable and compassionate direction. The task for believers is not to apply the letter of the New Testament as static law, but to identify and continue to project this trajectory through history and into their present context."

He explicitly rejects traditional satisfaction or penal substitution models that portray God the Father demanding Jesus' death as a blood sacrifice. Instead, the Cross is understood as the culmination of human violence and the \"age-old crime of scapegoating an innocent victim\".

The Cross, in Flood's view, unmasks the \"scapegoat mechanism\" and the \"myth of redemptive violence\". These are human-devised, retributive systems of blame and punishment.

He addresses how the Bible can be considered inspired if it seems to command or approve of profoundly immoral acts. His answer lies in understanding that the violence is not from God, but from human hearts, which project this violence onto God. In this framework, God's response to human violence, systemic oppression, and suffering is revealed through the Cross, where God is shown to be \"taking upon Himself the violence of the whole world\"."

A key ethical imperative is to embody God's non-violent character through \"enemy-love,\" putting Jesus' instructions into creative and constructive practice.

This perspective informs his view that God is always about \"2nd chances,\" even citing Cain as an example.

His work is deeply influential across various disciplines, including biblical studies, peace studies, theology, and psychology. Among his numerous influential works are <em>The Human Being</em>, <em>The Bible in Human Transformation</em>, <em>Homosexuality and Christian Faith</em>, <em>Jesus and Nonviolence: A Third Way</em>, and especially <em>The Powers</em> trilogy: <em>Naming the Powers</em>, <em>Unmasking the Powers</em>, and <em>Engaging the Powers</em>.",

            "content": "Wink's understanding of <strong>\"the Powers\"</strong> is foundational to his theology. He posits a \"cosmology of power\" where \"spirituality\" is seen as the \"interiority\"—or \"angel\"—of people, institutions, and even nations. These Powers are fundamentally good in their creation, but have \"fallen,\" yet retain the potential to be \"redeemed to their higher, God-given vocation\". Rather than viewing them as external, separate spiritual beings, Wink understands them as systemic realities. These Powers represent systemic evil, embodying structural realities that exert influence in the world."

            "heading": "Domination System",
            "content": "Wink's work analyzes how the fallen Powers organize into oppressive structures. His work exposed the \"abuse of power\" and revealed the \"social, economic, psychological, and spiritual dynamics by which they oppress\". This oppressive nature is exemplified in the observation that the \"political power of the world is invariably fallen and therefore, to varying degrees, blind\". Examples include the \"landed power\" in Scotland and big landowners taking on \"kingdoms idolatrously,\" or multinational corporations being associated with \"Mammon and Moloch\". These illustrate how Powers become organized into systems of exploitation and hierarchy, often presenting their actions as inherently good or even divinely sanctioned."

            "heading": "Jesus and the Powers",
            "content": "Jesus' approach, according to Wink's framework, is characterized by <strong>nonviolent resistance</strong> to the Powers. Instead of advocating for either violent retaliation or passive submission, Jesus offers a \"third way\". This involves a \"pacifist and countercultural life and teaching that modeled freedom from the powers\". Jesus' victory over these powers involved \"his refusal to retaliate as they conspired to kill him\". Wink's practical formula for engaging the Powers includes: 1) Name the Powers (courage to break silence, state abuse of power); 2) Unmask the Powers (reveal social, economic, psychological, spiritual dynamics of oppression); and 3) Engage the Powers (wrestling with them, not to destroy or take life, but to call them back to their higher, God-given calling)."

            "content": "Wink's theology challenges the <strong>\"myth of redemptive violence\"</strong>—the pervasive cultural belief that violence can save or bring peace. This perspective views the cross as demonstrating that God is not violent, but \"has been taking upon Himself the violence of the whole world\". Jesus went willingly to the cross to \"unmask the scapegoat mechanism, revealed the violence inherent within the heart of men, exposed the myth of redemptive violence, and brought an end to the war that men had waged on God for centuries\". This challenges traditional satisfaction atonement theories that misrepresent God as requiring retributive violence."

            "heading": "Nonviolent Atonement",
            "content": "Wink's understanding of atonement emphasizes Jesus' victory over evil powers through his entire life, death, and resurrection. The atonement is not about God requiring violence to satisfy divine justice. Instead, it highlights God's nonviolent raising of Jesus from the dead as the crucial act that \"validated Jesus' way of life as God's way and exposed the powers as rebels against God\". Jesus' death is seen as a revelation of the consequences of humanity's violence and the domination system, rather than a satisfaction of divine wrath. Jesus' victory is seen not in a violent murder that God needs, but in Jesus' life of freedom from the powers and his exposure of their true nature and ultimate weakness."

            "heading": "Transforming the Powers",
            "content": "Central to Wink's vision is the possibility of redeeming, rather than destroying, the fallen Powers. His three-part formula for engagement culminates in \"wrestling so as not to destroy them—not to take life—but rather, to call them back to their higher, God-given calling\". This transformation involves both inner spiritual work and outer activism. Wink posits that the inner life or \"prayer\" is the \"interior battlefield where the decisive victory is first won, before engagement in the outer world is even attempted\". This deep engagement of \"head, heart and hand\" draws the engaged person into \"life incarnate\"."

            "heading": "Practical Engagement",
            "content": "Walter Wink's theology translates directly into activism and social change. Examples include Scottish Land Reform, where activists challenged \"landed power\" by \"telling the story of the oppressed,\" leading to community ownership and the Land Reform Scotland Act. In the Isle of Harris Superquarry case, activists publicly named, unmasked, and engaged the principalities and powers behind the project, using terms like Mammon and Moloch, ultimately leading to the corporation's withdrawal. Wink's insights also inform work with military officers on nonviolence and analysis of advertising industry powers. These examples illustrate how Wink's theology informs holistic spiritual activism, where the church's role is to confront systemic evil through active, nonviolent love."

He initiated a \"psychological challenge to landed power\" in Scotland, asserting that land ownership is not merely economic but deeply \"psychospiritual\". In his analysis, large landowners often use land to compensate for their \"ontological insecurity\" and \"take on kingdoms idolatrously,\" which in turn damages community integrity. His practical strategy involved establishing a land trust with the objective of bringing the Isle of Eigg into community ownership. This approach, consistent with liberation theology's focus on the \"underside of history,\" involved \"telling the story of the oppressed,\" which deterred typical wealthy buyers."

His broad spiritual understanding encompasses concepts such as the Quaker \"that of God in all,\" Buddha-nature, and Hindu Atman/Brahman.

In Scottish Land Reform, he challenged \"landed power\" not only legally but also psychologically, by \"telling the story of the oppressed\" to disrupt the market and empower the community. In opposition to the Isle of Harris superquarry development, McIntosh publicly named the \"principalities and the powers\" behind the proposal, labeling the \"spirit\" as \"Mammon and Moloch\".

McIntosh stresses the need to confront the \"doodoo of the world\" and \"process it into rich compost from which new life can grow,\" a process that yields the \"fruit of compassion\".

His own spiritual journey and activism were nurtured within communal contexts, specifically mentioning \"Peace House—a project of the Quakers and the Iona Community\".

He learned from Wink that the \"Powers that Be are Good. But the Powers are fallen. Yet the Powers can be redeemed to their higher, God-given vocation\". This foundational belief informs his three-step process: 1) Naming the Powers (breaking silence and courageously stating abuse of power); 2) Unmasking the Powers (revealing social, economic, psychological, and spiritual dynamics of oppression); 3) Engaging the Powers (wrestling with them not to destroy but to call them back to their higher, God-given calling).

He warns that without this inner liberation, social activism risks becoming mere \"self-justifying good works\" or devolving into \"counter-Power\" rather than true transformation. His personal rejection of the \"blood atonement theory of the crucifixion\" indicates his theological emphasis on a non-violent understanding of redemption, where \"to die for love\" is the true act of atonement. This non-violent, transformative view of atonement, where God's love and compassion are central, underpins his entire approach to activism and violence."

      "introduction": "In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed a revolutionary new model of the atom. By blending classical physics with Planck's new quantum idea, he solved a major paradox and provided the first successful explanation for the structure of the atom.",

          "content": "The prevailing model, developed by Ernest Rutherford, pictured the atom as a miniature solar system, with light electrons orbiting a heavy central nucleus. According to classical electromagnetism, an orbiting electron is an accelerating charge and should continuously radiate energy, causing it to spiral into the nucleus in a fraction of a second. Classical atoms should not be stable."

          "heading": "Bohr's Quantum Postulate",
          "content": "Bohr made a radical proposal. He postulated that electrons could only exist in certain specific, 'allowed' orbits or energy levels. While in one of these special orbits, an electron would not radiate energy, in direct violation of classical laws. It was a bold, ad-hoc solution that incorporated Planck's idea of quantization into the very structure of matter."

          "heading": "A 'Stepping Stone' Model",
          "content": "The Bohr Model was a crucial, though ultimately incomplete, step. It was a hybrid model, mixing classical ideas of orbits with new quantum rules. While it was later superseded by the full theory of quantum mechanics, it was the first model to successfully explain the stability of atoms and the specific frequencies of light they emit, and it introduced the idea of quantized energy levels to atomic physics."

      "display_name": "The Quantum Leap",
      "introduction": "A key feature of Bohr's model of the atom was the 'quantum leap'—a concept that highlighted the bizarre, non-classical nature of the subatomic world. It was a direct challenge to the continuous, predictable motion of Newtonian physics.",

          "heading": "Explaining Atomic Spectra",
          "content": "Scientists had known for decades that different elements, when heated, emit light only at specific, characteristic frequencies (their 'emission spectra'). Bohr explained this phenomenon by proposing that an electron could 'leap' from a higher energy orbit to a lower one, emitting a single quantum of light (a photon) in the process. The energy of this photon—and thus its color—was precisely equal to the energy difference between the two orbits."

          "heading": "An Instantaneous Jump",
          "content": "The truly strange part of the quantum leap is that it is instantaneous and discontinuous. The electron is in one orbit, and then it is in another. It does not travel through the space in between. This idea was a profound break from classical intuition, where all motion is smooth and continuous."

The electron's behavior was governed by strange, discrete jumps, not by the smooth, predictable paths of Newton's laws."

A quantum object has both potentials, but we can only ever observe one aspect at a time. The experimental setup itself determines which property is revealed."

You cannot design an experiment to measure both simultaneously. According to Bohr, it is meaningless to ask what the electron 'really is' independent of an experiment; its properties are only defined in the context of a measurement."

The interpretation holds that this collapse is fundamentally random; there is no deeper cause determining the outcome."

It is a pragmatic and operational interpretation that focuses on the results of experiments rather than speculating about an unobservable underlying reality. While many alternative interpretations have been proposed, it remains the first and most widely taught way of thinking about the quantum world."

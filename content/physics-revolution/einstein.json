      "display_name": "The Miracle Year",
      "introduction": "In 1905, a 26-year-old patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, named Albert Einstein published four papers that would forever change the course of physics. This single year, known as his 'annus mirabilis' or miracle year, marked the arrival of a revolutionary new mind.",

          "heading": "An Unlikely Genius",
          "content": "At the time, Einstein was an outsider, unable to secure an academic position and working a mundane job examining patent applications. Yet, this isolation may have given him the freedom to think about the deepest problems in physics, away from the constraints of conventional academic thought."

To explain the photoelectric effect, he proposed that light itself is not a continuous wave, but is made up of discrete energy particles, which we now call photons. This was a radical idea that provided crucial evidence for the reality of quanta and would later win him the Nobel Prize."

He showed that this motion was caused by the particles being jostled by individual atoms, providing the first definitive, experimental proof of the existence of atoms."

The third introduced the Special Theory of Relativity, resolving the conflict between Newton's and Maxwell's physics. The fourth was a short addendum that presented a stunning consequence of this theory: a relationship between mass and energy, which would become the world's most famous equation."

      "introduction": "Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity was his solution to the paradox raised by Maxwell's equations. To solve it, he started with two simple postulates and followed their logic to a conclusion that completely overthrew Newton's concepts of absolute space and time.",

The first, the <strong>Principle of Relativity</strong>, states that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion. The second, the <strong>Principle of the Constancy of the Speed of Light</strong>, states that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their own motion."

Einstein's theory showed that time is not absolute. A moving clock ticks more slowly than a stationary one, a phenomenon known as 'time dilation.' What's more, two events that appear simultaneous to one observer may not appear simultaneous to another."

Space and time were no longer a fixed, universal backdrop for events, but were dynamic quantities whose measurements depended on the observer's motion."

Newton's gravity was an instantaneous force, an 'action at a distance' that violated the new cosmic speed limit: the speed of light. This contradiction drove Einstein to seek a new theory of gravitation."

Instead, the massive Sun creates a deep 'dent' in the fabric of spacetime around it. The planet is simply following the straightest possible path through this curved spacetime, which results in an elliptical orbit."

The theory is essential for the operation of modern GPS systems, which must account for the fact that time passes slightly faster for satellites in orbit than it does on Earth's surface. The recent detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes is another stunning confirmation of his theory."

He was ultimately unsuccessful, but this dream of unification remains a primary goal of theoretical physics today, in the form of string theory and other 'theories of everything.'"

      "introduction": "In the mid-19th century, electricity and magnetism were understood as two separate, though strangely related, phenomena. James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist, achieved one of the greatest unifications in the history of science by showing they were two aspects of a single, underlying force.",

          "content": "Scientists like Ørsted had shown that an electric current could create a magnetic force, and Michael Faraday had shown that a changing magnetic field could induce an electric current. The link was undeniable, but a single, comprehensive mathematical theory that described this relationship was missing."

While Faraday was a brilliant experimentalist, he lacked the formal mathematical training to describe his discoveries in a rigorous way. Maxwell took Faraday's intuitive ideas, particularly the concept of lines of force, and set out to translate them into a precise mathematical framework."

His work was the second great unification in physics, after Newton had unified terrestrial and celestial gravity."

This concept troubled many physicists, including Newton himself. How could one object affect another without touching it?"

          "content": "Michael Faraday proposed a new mental picture. He imagined that a magnet or an electric charge creates invisible 'lines of force' that permeate the space around it. Another object then interacts with these lines. The force is local, transmitted by the state of space itself."

          "heading": "Maxwell's Mathematical Field",

An electric charge doesn't pull on another charge from a distance; it creates an electric field in the space around it, and the other charge then responds to the field at its specific location. This new worldview would become essential for Einstein's theory of relativity."

The fact that there are no magnetic monopoles. 3. How a changing magnetic field creates an electric field (Faraday's Law). 4. How an electric current AND a changing electric field create a magnetic field (Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition)."

He realized that a changing electric field should also create a magnetic field, just as a changing magnetic field creates an electric one. This 'displacement current' was the missing piece of the puzzle that made the equations perfectly symmetrical."

From the workings of a simple magnet to the operation of an electric motor and the behavior of radio waves, everything could be derived from this compact and beautiful set of laws. Physicist Richard Feynman noted, 'From a long view of the history of mankind... there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell's discovery of the laws of electrodynamics.'"

Physicists thus assumed that light waves must travel through an invisible, undetectable medium that filled the entire universe, which they called the luminiferous aether."

However, Maxwell's equations predicted that the speed of light ('c') was a universal constant, independent of the motion of the source or the observer."

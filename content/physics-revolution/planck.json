      "introduction": "One of the most vexing 'clouds' was the inability of classical physics to correctly predict the spectrum of light emitted by a perfectly absorbing and emitting object, known as a 'blackbody.'

This was a physical absurdity, famously dubbed the 'ultraviolet catastrophe.' It meant that even a warm object should emit a blinding, lethal amount of high-energy radiation, which was obviously not the case."

The energy of a single quantum was proportional to the frequency of the radiation."

This meant that high-frequency light (like ultraviolet) could only be emitted in large energy packets, which was statistically much less likely, thus preventing the 'ultraviolet catastrophe.'"

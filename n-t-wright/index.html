              "central_focus": "Jesus’ death is a decisive victory over the powers of darkness, sin, and death, inaugurating the Kingdom of God.",
              "penal_substitution_rejection": "Wright explicitly rejects the idea that God's wrath falls on Jesus instead of His people, or that God set Jesus forth as a 'propitiation' to turn away wrath, stating that *hilastērion* does not mean a 'propitiatory sacrifice' where Jesus is punished for others' sins. He calls traditional penal substitution 'pagan' or a 'caricature'.",
              "representative_substitution_concept": "While rejecting classical penal substitution, Wright's view does include a form of substitution. He argues God condemned 'Sin' (a personified force) in the flesh of Jesus, not Jesus himself. Jesus bore the punishment marked out for his fellow Jews, embodying Israel going down into death. This allows sinners 'in the Messiah' to avoid condemnation.",
              "sin_definition": "For Wright, the basic 'sin' is idolatry—worshipping anything in place of God. Sin is primarily an enslaving force that prevents humans from fulfilling their vocation.",
              "forgiveness_of_sins": "This concept signifies the end of Israel's exile and liberation for the restoration of creation and the true human vocation (image-bearers, royal priesthood).",
              "biblical_narrative_context": "The cross is deeply rooted in OT motifs like Passover, Exile, and Day of Atonement, not as mere decorations but as central to understanding Jesus' New Exodus vocation. Jesus' death is the climax of evil gathering itself and doing its worst on the true Man, leading to the overthrow of dark powers."

                "title": "Christian Mission According to Wright",
                "definition": "Implementing the victory Jesus won on the cross, proclaiming and embodying the dual meanings of his death (victorious and substitutionary). It's about participating with the Spirit in worship and justice as God's cruciform people on earth.",
                "rejection_of_shrunken_view": "Not simply telling people about Jesus so they can go to heaven. It's about restoring humans to their vocation as image-bearers and caring for the world God loves.",
                "redefining_power": "Jesus' victory redefines power from coercion to suffering love. Mission involves confronting idols like money, sex, and war, and working for justice and peace.",
                "sacramental_life": "Sustained by baptism (dying to sin, raised to new life) and communion (declaring Lord's death, sharing in his body/blood), which are central to the church's mission.",
                "political_theology": "The good news of God's kingdom has implications for every community and policy; followers are to 'speak truth to power'."

            "overall_assessment": "TDRB is described as poorly-argued, potentially harmful, distorted, and unbalanced, receiving too much praise and too little criticism.",
            "straw_man_argument": "Wright is accused of using 'straw men' by misrepresenting what evangelicals believe about sin (arbitrary commandments) and Jesus' salvific work (God wanting to kill humans, Jesus 'got in the way'). He is seen as presenting caricatures rather than actual evangelical beliefs.",
            "incomplete_unbalanced_cross_view": "Critics found Wright unclear on how the cross saves from God's wrath and on the mechanism of atonement. He is accused of avoiding the issue of how Jesus' death delivers from God's wrath.",
            "misinterpretation_of_ot": {
                "title": "Misinterpretation of the Old Testament",
                "passover": "Contrary to Wright's assertion, the Passover narrative *is* predicated on substitution and set against the backdrop of Yahweh's wrath against both Egypt's and Israel's sin. Jesus' framing his death against Passover encourages a view of it as a penal and substitutionary sacrifice. The Passover in Ezekiel's eschatological temple, Josephus, and Rabbinic texts *is* connected with atonement.",
                "exile": "The exile motif in Scripture is portrayed as the outbreak of God’s wrath against His people, and Jesus' death is portrayed in similar terms, implying the outpouring of wrath on Jesus in Israel's place.",
                "day_of_atonement_yom_kippur": "Wright's claim that Yom Kippur rituals have 'nothing to do with punishment' is rejected. The essence of atonement in the Pentateuch is to stay Yahweh's wrath, and the ritual's purpose is to *prevent* the outbreak of wrath. The scapegoat bears Israel's iniquity so Israel need not, indicating penal substitution.",
                "methodological_flaw": "Wright's exegetical method is criticized as 'reduction by dissection,' forcing OT images to fit his new atonement theory and not allowing two-way interaction between Old and New Testaments."
            },
            "rejection_of_classical_penal_substitution": "Critics assert that Wright’s 'representative-substitutionary atonement' is not classical penal substitution (PSA) because he defines sin as an impersonal force (capital 'S' Sin) rather than a personal rebellious act against God. This leads to the cross being a mechanism to neutralize Sin's power rather than God judging the sins of rebellious sinners. Some argue that his view aligns more with the Christus Victor theory.",
            "either_orism_critique": "Wright is accused of presenting false dichotomies (either P or Q) when a 'both-and' (not only P, but also Q) approach is more biblically accurate. This applies to his views on sin (force vs. moral failure) and God's action (condemning sin vs. atoning for sin).",
            "lack_of_adam_and_fall": "One critique suggests Wright's historical narrative of salvation doesn't go back far enough to Adam's sin of rebellion, which would provide a more fundamental understanding of sin and the necessity of classical PSA."
          },
          "theological_concepts_highlighted": {
            "title": "Key Theological Concepts",
            "atonement": "<strong>Atonement:</strong> The means by which reconciliation between God and humanity is achieved. Critiqued for its oversimplification in popular Christianity and Wright's alternative emphasis.",
            "penal_substitutionary_atonement_psa": "<strong>Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA):</strong> The traditional view that Christ took the sinner's place in bearing guilt and suffering divine punishment to satisfy divine justice. It is seen by some as the 'heart' of atonement.",
            "christus_victor_theory": "<strong>Christus Victor Theory:</strong> Emphasizes Christ's decisive victory over powers like sin, death, and Satan, releasing humanity from bondage. Wright's view is seen by critics as bearing hallmarks of this theory.",
            "moral_influence_theory": "<strong>Moral Influence Theory:</strong> Suggests Christ's death is an exemplary act of sacrificial love to influence sinners to repent. It's argued to be deficient without penal substitution as its basis.",
            "sin": "<strong>Sin:</strong> Discussed as both a moral fault/transgression and an enslaving, personified force ('Sin' with a capital S).",
            "divine_wrath": "<strong>Divine Wrath:</strong> A key point of contention. Some sources emphasize it as integral to the OT narrative (Passover, Exile, Yom Kippur) and a central consequence of sin from which people need rescue. Wright's view is criticized for avoiding or rejecting its direct application to Jesus as punishment.",
            "baptism": "<strong>Baptism:</strong> Understood as a ritual death and new life in the Messiah, drawing on Exodus themes of passage through waters. It symbolizes going down into death to be reborn into God's new creation, and is no longer geographically limited, being for the whole world. Paul in Romans 6 views baptism as dying with the Messiah.",
            "exodus_narrative": "<strong>Exodus Narrative:</strong> A foundational theme for understanding Jesus' life and mission, particularly baptism and the cross. Jesus' life is compared to Moses' and shaped by Exodus motifs. Romans 6, 7, and 8 are seen as retelling the whole Exodus story."
